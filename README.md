I have developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game, a two-player strategy game that can be enjoyed on any device. The game features a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for players of all ages to engage. 
Each player takes turns marking their symbol, either X or O, on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game dynamically checks 
for winning conditions and declares a winner or a draw when all spaces are filled. An option to reset the game is included, allowing for endless rounds of play. The design focuses on responsive performance, 
ensuring smooth gameplay. Built with clean and efficient code, the game is lightweight and fast-loading, providing an enjoyable and seamless user experience. Whether played casually or competitively, 
this Tic Tac Toe game promises fun and challenge.
